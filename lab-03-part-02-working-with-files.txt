16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------
The contents of the file are displayed.

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

head books/other/pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince

==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

tail books/other/pg1232.txt

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------

more books/other/pg1232.txt
less books/other/pg1232.txt

Spacebar scrolls prints another portion of the file and "q" quits.

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------

I would use tail to view the end of a file and I would use head to see the beginning of a file. Cat would display all of the file's contents. Less/More would be used to read it a portion at a time.
